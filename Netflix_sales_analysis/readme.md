**Overview**

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset related to Netflix using Python in Google Colab.
The aim is to uncover business insights by cleaning, visualising, and summarising sales data—highlighting trends, patterns, and opportunities in the streaming-sales context.


**Tools & Technologies**

Google Colab – cloud notebook environment for analysis and sharing.

Python – data manipulation (pandas, numpy), visualisation (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly).

Data Source – sales/subscription dataset (CSV/Excel) for Netflix-like business; adjust as per actual dataset used.


**Insights Derived**

Identify which content categories or genres are contributing most to sales/subscriptions.

Understand how sales/subscriptions evolve across time (monthly/quarterly) and any seasonal effects.

Compare regional markets to highlight strong/weak growth zones.

Detect patterns or anomalies (e.g., spike after major release, dips during off-season) for strategic decisions.


**How to Use**

Clone or download this repository.

Open the file Netflix_Sales_Analysis.ipynb in Google Colab (or locally in Jupyter if preferred).

Upload or link the dataset (e.g., dataset/Netflix_Sales_Data.csv) and run the cells.

Review the generated visualisations and summary tables for insights.

Optionally modify or extend the analysis: add filters, extra plots, segment analyses (e.g., by region, genre, subscription plan).

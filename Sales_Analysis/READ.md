**Overview**

This project carries out exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a sales dataset using Python in Google Colab.

The aim is to extract business-insights by cleaning, visualising, and summarising sales data—highlighting trends, patterns, and opportunities.


**Tools & Technologies**

1. **Google Colab:** cloud notebook environment — easy to share, no local setup needed.

2. **Python:** data manipulation with pandas, numpy; visualisation with matplotlib and seaborn (or plotly).

3. **Data Source:** sales dataset (CSV/Excel) used for analysis — modify as per your dataset.


**Insights Derived**

1. Identify which time-periods have the highest/lowest sales and why.

2. Find top performing products/categories and those that lag behind.

3. Understand regional or channel differences in sales performance.

4. Detect possible patterns such as seasonality, growth trends, or anomalies for further investigation.


**How to Use**

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Open the file Sales_Data_Analysis.ipynb in Google Colab.

3. Upload or link the dataset (e.g., dataset/Sales_Data.csv) and run the code cells.

4. Review the generated visualisations and summary tables.

5. Modify or extend the analysis: add filters, extra plots, or drill-downs as needed.
